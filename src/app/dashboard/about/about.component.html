            <p class="lead">This is Shivam, graphic designer and creative director born and living in New Delhi.</p>
            <p class="lead">Beginning my high school career in 2013, I developed a love of art specifically in the areas of creative and graphic design. Since then, I have been fervently studying and practicing these topics to offer innovative and compelling services.
                While my graphic design abilities allow me to produce anything from business cards to highway billboards, my understanding of both creative and technical aspects allows me to provide a range of services that depend on the requirements
                of the customer.</p>
            <p>Design has always been my passion and delivering appropriate branding experiences is the base of every project I worked on. I work across different media and platforms, from digital to physical.</p>
